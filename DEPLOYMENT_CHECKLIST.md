## 🎯 Before You Deploy

### 1. Update Google Verification Code
File: `src/app/layout.tsx` (line ~86)

```typescript
verification: {
  google: 'your-google-verification-code', // ← Replace this
},
```

**How to get the code:**
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Add property: `bunkheangheng.site`
3. Choose "HTML tag" verification method
4. Copy the code from `content="..."` attribute
5. Paste it in the verification field

### 2. Update Social Media Links (If Needed)
Check these files for social media URLs:
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (structured data)
- `src/app/components/hero.tsx` (buttons)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (footer links)

Current links:
- GitHub: `https://github.com/Bunkheang-heng`

- Twitter: `@bunkheangheng`

### 3. Update Email Address (If Needed)
Current email in metadata: `contact@bunkheangheng.site`

If you use a different email, update it in:
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (line ~130, 186)
- `src/app/components/SEOStructuredData.tsx` (line ~71)
- `public/humans.txt` (line 3)
